# Add to Notion – Bookmark Saver Extension

A lightweight browser extension that lets you save the current page to your Notion database — complete with title, URL, notes, and optional metadata like author or tags. This is meant to save a bunch of links to papers, videos, and what not to encourage learning. Like a little library when you are bored.

## Features

- Save current tab to your Notion database with one click
- Automatically capture:
  - Page title
  - URL
  - Notes (optional)
- Optional: Use OpenAI API to extract extra fields like tags or content type (needs some work to be fixed)
- Configurable via Options page
